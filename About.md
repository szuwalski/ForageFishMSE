## Forage Fish Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)
The forage fish MSE tool allows users to explore the performance of harvest control rules on populations with different characteristics. 

### Characteristics
-
These are important BECAUSE I SAID SO.

### Adult harvest
-
This is the fraction of the adult population that is harvested.  The value must be between zero and one.

### Egg harvest
-
This is the fraction of eggs that are harvested.  The value must be between zero and one.

### Recruitment variability
-
This specifies the autoregressive (AR1) structure for recruitment.  Here is some intuition about the parameter values.  TAKE IT.

### Harvest limit
-
This is the population size at which the fishery closes and is relative to virgin biomass.  The value it will take is between zero and one.
