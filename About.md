## Forage Fish Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)
The forage fish MSE tool allows users to explore the performance of harvest control rules on populations with different characteristics. Several characteristics of the management strategy can be manipulated (see below) and the results of the application of the harvest control rule to the population will be shown.

### Adult harvest
This is the fraction of the adult population that is harvested.  

### Egg harvest
This is the fraction of eggs that are harvested.  

### Recruitment variability
This specifies how variable recruitment is. A larger number equals more variability.

### Recruitment autocorrelation
This specifies the autoregressive (AR1) structure for recruitment.  A higher value means that this year's recruitment will be more similar to last year's recruitment on average.

### Harvest limit
This is the population size at which the fishery closes and is relative to virgin biomass.
